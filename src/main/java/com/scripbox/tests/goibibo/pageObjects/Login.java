/*The purpose of this class is to define the page objects of the goibibo website.
 * The idea is to maintain all the page objects(XPaths) at a single location so that maintaining them becomes easy.
 * We can even create a folder called PageObjects and then create multiple classes with each class referring to
 * the page objects of single web page in the goibibo website.*/
